Research by Dr Stubbs has also shown that exercise also increases electrical activity in the emotional processing areas of the brain, particularly the hippocampus and the pre-frontal cortex.Exercise triggers the release of endorphins into the bloodstream, relieving pain and producing a feeling of well-being.
